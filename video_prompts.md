## **1. Mood Symphony**

**Video Prompt:**
A dark velvet-black space surrounds the scene. Ribbons of glowing, iridescent light swirl slowly in the distance. Each colour represents a different feeling. The camera moves smoothly through the swirling lights. Small shimmering particles float in the air, forming ghostlike faces for a moment before fading away. Some faces smile, others look thoughtful. The lights pulse gently in rhythm, like a slow heartbeat.

**Caption:**
Where colours breathe and feelings flow,
A quiet spell in a gentle glow.

## **2. Thought Streams**

**Video Prompt:**
A futuristic city skyline at dusk. Glass towers glow with soft golden light. Streams of transparent light drift between the buildings like flowing ribbons. Inside each stream, glowing words and small symbols float. Two streams merge together, creating a soft golden burst of light that glows across the streets below. The camera moves slowly through the city, following the streams.

**Caption:**
Through silver threads our thoughts combine,
In sparks of gold, your dreams align.

## **3. Emotional Weather**

**Video Prompt:**
A wide digital meadow stretches to the horizon. The sky shifts from clear sunshine to swirling storm clouds, then to a glowing night filled with green and purple auroras. The ground changes with the weather — flowers bloom in the sunlight, gentle waves ripple in the rain, and under the aurora, the grass glows softly. The camera pans slowly across the changing landscape.

**Caption:**
Like shifting skies, our hearts will change,
From sunlit warmth to dreams so strange.

## **4. Mindful Horizons**

**Video Prompt:**
A calm horizon with the sun rising and setting in fast motion. Light reflects off the land in soft holographic patterns. Silhouetted figures sit in meditation. Above them, glowing orbs appear, floating upward into the sky. The orbs fade into tiny shimmering particles as they rise. Trails of light remain for a moment before disappearing.

**Caption:**
In stillness bright, new dreams take flight,
A whispered charm in the fading light.

## **5. Heartbeats of Tomorrow**

**Video Prompt:**
A crystal-like heart floats in the centre of the frame. Each heartbeat sends out glowing ripples through a futuristic city. Buildings shimmer in unison, trees sway gently, and clouds glow softly in rhythm with the heart. The scene feels connected, as if the whole world breathes together.

**Caption:**
One rhythm shared, one silent thread,
The world beats on where dreams are fed.

I kept every caption in a **two-line rhyming style** so they’re easy to overlay on video without crowding the frame.

If you want, I can also make **a second set with even shorter captions** so they’re more like Apple’s “one-liner impact” ads, while keeping the Harry Potter undertones. Would you like me to prepare that as well?
