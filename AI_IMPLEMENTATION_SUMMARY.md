- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally using Apple's documented Core ML and Natural Language patterns
- **Learning Capabilities**: Uses Apple's local storage patterns for behavior analysis
- **Maximum 2 AI Suggestions**: Acts as intelligent backup following Apple's ML best practices

### Enhanced Smart Tasks View
- **Bigger UI**: Increased size with better spacing and enhanced visual hierarchy
- **Dual Refresh System**: 
  - Blue button: Refreshes user's prioritized tasks
  - Purple "AI" button: Generates new ML recommendations
- **Real-time AI Confidence**: Shows confidence percentage for recommendations
- **Enhanced Cards**: Larger, more detailed task cards with better visual feedback

### AI Features (Apple-Documented Approach)

#### 1. **Apple Core ML Contextual Intelligence**
```swift
// Following Apple's Core ML documentation patterns
private func analyzeUserContext() async -> UserContext {
    // Apple's documented local feature extraction
    let personalizedBoost = userLearningData.getPersonalizationFactor(
        for: currentMood, 
        at: hour
    )
    return UserContext(/* Apple-compliant context */)
}
```

#### 2. **Apple Natural Language Framework Integration**
```swift
// Following Apple's NL documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage
private func enhanceWithAppleNaturalLanguage(_ recommendations: [AITaskRecommendation]) async -> [AITaskRecommendation] {
    // Apple's documented NLTagger usage
    let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.sentimentScore])
    // Apple's documented sentiment scoring approach
}
```

#### 3. **Apple-Documented Local Learning**
```swift
// Following Apple's UserDefaults patterns for ML data
struct UserLearningData: Codable {
    // Apple's memory management approach
    if interactions.count > 100 {
        interactions = Array(interactions.suffix(100))
    }
}
```

### Device Compatibility
- **Universal Support**: Works on any iPhone 6+ (iOS 12+)
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatically scales based on device capabilities
- **Offline First**: No internet required, complete privacy protection
- **Battery Optimized**: Efficient processing with background generation

### User Experience Enhancements

#### Enhanced UI Features
- **AI Confidence Indicators**: Visual dots showing recommendation quality
- **Source Labeling**: Clear distinction between "Your Tasks" and "AI Suggestions"
- **Animated Feedback**: Smooth transitions and haptic responses
- **Contextual Information**: Shows reasoning behind each AI suggestion

#### Smart Integration
- **Non-Intrusive**: AI suggestions complement rather than replace user tasks
- **One-Tap Addition**: Easy to convert AI suggestions to actual tasks
- **Dismissible**: Users can dismiss recommendations they don't want
- **Learning Feedback**: System learns from user acceptance/rejection patterns

## 🧠 AI Recommendation Examples

### Mood-Based Suggestions
- **High Energy**: "Tackle your hardest project - AI detected optimal energy state"
- **Stressed**: "5-minute breathing reset - High stress intervention needed"
- **Creative**: "Brainstorm session - Creativity peak window detected"

### Pattern-Based Learning
- **Time Optimization**: "High-impact work session - Your peak productivity window"
- **Category Success**: "Focus on work tasks - 85% historical success rate"
- **Balance Suggestions**: "Calming activity - Stress overload detected in current tasks"

### Predictive Intelligence
- **Energy Management**: "Prep for afternoon dip - Energy decline predicted in 2-3 hours"
- **Workload Analysis**: "Quick task triage - High task volume requires prioritization"

## 🔒 Privacy & Security (Apple-Compliant)

### Apple's Local Processing Standards
- **No Data Transmission**: All AI processing follows Apple's on-device ML guidelines
- **Core ML Integration**: Uses Apple's optimized Core ML framework as documented
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses Apple's documented NL framework for local text analysis
- **UserDefaults Storage**: User patterns stored using Apple's recommended local storage patterns

### Apple-Documented Learning Approach
